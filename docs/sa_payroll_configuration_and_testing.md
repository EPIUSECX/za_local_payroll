# SA Payroll Configuration and Testing Practitioner Guide

This guide explains how to configure, test, and validate South African payroll functionality in ZA Local.

## Purpose And Scope

SA Payroll extends HRMS payroll for South African statutory payroll processing. It supports PAYE, UIF, SDL, ETI, retirement fund treatment, medical tax credits, employer contributions, payroll reports, EMP201, EMP501, and IRP5 / IT3(a) certificate working papers.

HRMS is required for payroll execution. ZA Local does not replace HRMS payroll; it extends HRMS Salary Slip, Salary Structure, Payroll Entry, and related payroll workflows where HRMS is installed.

Direct SARS electronic submission is not supported. The app does not generate the SARS BRS payroll-import CSV or encrypted reconciliation file. Generic exports and PDFs are review aids only; capture approved figures through eFiling/e@syFile or use a separately validated BRS-compatible integration.

Use the current [SARS Guide for Employers](https://www.sars.gov.za/guide-for-employers-in-respect-of-employees-tax-2027/) and the applicable PAYE BRS/validation rules as primary references. Archive the exact publications used for annual signoff.

## Annual Statutory Update Checklist

ZA Local is designed so a new South African payroll year is primarily a statutory data update, not a rewrite of payroll logic.

Each year, before the first March payroll:

1. Add a new `statutory_rates_YYYY.json` rate pack under `za_local_payroll/setup/data`.
2. Capture PAYE brackets, rebates, tax thresholds, medical tax credits, UIF cap and rates, ETI brackets, reimbursive travel rate, subsistence rates, retirement cap, COIDA earnings cap, source reference, and effective dates.
3. Add or update Payroll Period, Income Tax Slab, and Tax Rebates fixtures for the new year.
4. Commit the versioned pack and fixtures, back up, migrate a restored staging site, and verify the Desk-reviewable records. `refresh_sa_tax_tables` is a System Manager maintenance action, not a normal payroll-user step.
5. Run the payroll compliance tests and compare golden fictional payroll cases for the new year.
6. Practitioner signs off the new pack before processing March payroll.

Do not edit old statutory packs after payroll has been processed for that year. If SARS republishes a correction, add a new dated correction pack or document the adjustment in the source reference and rerun the affected regression tests.

## Configuration Tutorial

### 1. Configure Company Statutory References

1. Open `Company`.
2. Capture PAYE reference number.
3. Capture UIF reference number.
4. Capture SDL reference number.
5. Capture COIDA reference where applicable.
6. Save.

Validation:

- EMP501 readiness checks can find employer references.
- IRP5 / IT3(a) certificate fields can be populated from Company.

### 2. Configure Payroll Settings

1. Open `Payroll Settings`.
2. Set the PAYE salary component.
3. Set the UIF employee salary component.
4. Set the UIF employer salary component.
5. Set the SDL salary component.
6. Review any payroll frequency, rounding, or working-day settings required by HRMS.
7. Save.

Validation:

- Statutory components are selectable.
- Components are mapped to the correct salary component type and account rows.

### 3. Review Salary Components

Open `Salary Component` and review:

- Basic Salary.
- Allowances.
- Overtime.
- Commission.
- Bonuses.
- PAYE.
- UIF Employee Contribution.
- UIF Employer Contribution.
- SDL Contribution.
- Pension, provident, retirement annuity, or retirement fund components.
- Medical aid deduction and employer contribution components.
- Non-statutory deductions such as staff loans, garnishee orders, and union subscriptions.

For each component, confirm:

- Type is earning, deduction, or company contribution as intended.
- Account row exists for the company.
- SARS payroll code is mapped where the component must appear on EMP201, IRP5, or deduction reports.
- Components that must not appear on IRP5 are explicitly excluded where the app provides that option.
- SA Payroll Treatment, PAYE Inclusion %, UIF Applicable, SDL Applicable, COIDA Applicable, Reimbursement, and Variable Pay Treatment are configured.
- Fixed travel allowances use 80% PAYE inclusion by default unless the 20% statutory rule is explicitly supportable and documented.
- Reimbursive travel components are separated from fixed travel allowances and reviewed against the prescribed rate for the tax year.

### 4. Review Tax Tables And Credits

1. Open `Income Tax Slab`.
2. Confirm the relevant South African tax year exists.
3. Confirm all PAYE brackets and rates.
4. Open `Tax Rebates and Medical Tax Credit`.
5. Confirm rebate rows and medical credit rows for the payroll year.
6. Save.

Validation:

- The Salary Structure Assignment can reference the correct Income Tax Slab.
- PAYE calculations use the expected tax year.

### 5. Configure Employees

For each employee:

1. Open `Employee`.
2. Set company, department, designation, date of joining, and employment status.
3. Set Employee Type.
4. Capture South African identity or passport details.
5. Capture income tax reference where available.
6. Capture bank details where salary payment and IRP5 output require them.
7. Capture ETI-related fields where ETI is applicable.
8. Capture Employment Equity fields if Labour reports are also used.
9. Save.

Validation:

- Employee can be used on Salary Structure Assignment.
- IRP5 readiness checks do not report avoidable missing fields.

### 6. Configure Medical And Fringe Benefits

Use `Employee Private Benefit` only for date-effective private medical scheme/medical-credit and retirement-annuity data. A medical credit requires an active record with a positive private-medical-aid contribution; capture the dependant count on that record and prevent overlapping active periods.

Use the separate submittable `Fringe Benefit` workflow for non-cash benefits. Link and submit the applicable Company Car, Housing or Low Interest Loan detail record, then submit the Fringe Benefit. Active submitted benefits are added to Salary Slips as taxable non-cash earnings: they affect PAYE and certificate reporting but do not increase cash gross/net pay or accounting earnings.

Validation:

- Company car uses 3.5%, or 3.25% with a maintenance plan, and the documented 80%/20% PAYE inclusion basis.
- Housing follows the paragraph 9 valuation and employee consideration rules using date-effective values.
- Low-interest loan uses current outstanding balance and the date-effective official rate.
- Draft, expired, disabled or unlinked benefit records do not affect payroll.

### 7. Configure Salary Structure

1. Create or open `Salary Structure`.
2. Add earnings.
3. Add deductions.
4. Add company contributions.
5. Ensure all components have account rows for the company.
6. Save and submit if required by HRMS.

Recommended test structures:

- Low salary structure.

- ETI qualifying structure.
- Medical aid structure.
- Retirement fund structure.
- Retirement cap stress structure.

### 8. Create Salary Structure Assignment

1. Open `Salary Structure Assignment`.
2. Select employee.
3. Select salary structure.
4. Set base amount.
5. Set from date.
6. Select Income Tax Slab.
7. Submit.

Validation:

- Salary Slip can be created from the assignment.
- Income tax slab is populated.

### 9. Process Payroll

1. Open `Payroll Entry`.
2. Select company, payroll period, payroll frequency, start date, and end date.
3. Get employees.
4. Create Salary Slips.
5. Review each Salary Slip.
6. Submit Salary Slips.
7. Submit Payroll Entry where applicable.
8. Post accounting entries.

Validation:

- Salary Slips calculate PAYE, UIF, SDL, ETI, retirement treatment, medical credits, and net pay correctly.
- GL Entries are balanced.
- Payroll payable and statutory liability accounts agree to payroll reports.

## Common Mistakes And Troubleshooting

- If Salary Slip does not calculate, check Salary Structure Assignment and Income Tax Slab.
- If PAYE is zero unexpectedly, check taxable earnings, rebates, and tax slab.
- If UIF is missing, check Payroll Settings and salary component mapping.
- If SDL is missing, check company contribution rows.
- If EMP201 is incomplete, check submitted Salary Slips and SARS payroll code mappings.
- If EMP501 blocks submission, complete missing EMP201 months or IRP5 certificate references.
- Do not upload a generic EMP501/IRP5 CSV exported from the app to SARS; it is not a BRS payroll-import file.
- If IRP5 PDF is incomplete, review Company, Employee, Address, Salary Component, and certificate line data.
- If GL does not post correctly, review salary component account rows for the company.

## Practitioner Responsibility

Payroll practitioners must validate every statutory rate, employee classification, benefit valuation, PAYE/UIF/SDL/ETI value, EMP201/EMP501 working paper, certificate, bank control total and GL posting before filing or payment. Only FNB Online Banking Enterprise CSV is currently enabled, through a submitted Payroll Payment Batch, and it requires bank acceptance testing. ZA Local supports calculation and review; it does not remove practitioner responsibility.
