# Annual Statutory Update

South African rates change annually and sometimes during a year. This is the controlled procedure to roll `za_local_payroll` forward. Do not assume a change is data-only until release notes, schema and calculation impacts have been assessed. (The authoritative version ships in `docs/annual_statutory_rate_update.md`.)

Remember: the tax year runs **1 March to end February**, and files are suffixed with the **year of assessment** (the calendar year the tax year ends).

## When to run

After the annual Budget (usually late February) and once SARS publishes the new PAYE tables, rebates, thresholds and Budget Tax Guide. Some figures are gazetted separately and on different dates — see the watch list.

## Step 1 — Add the statutory rate pack

The rate pack is the single source of truth for date-effective calculations.

1. Copy the latest `za_local_payroll/setup/data/statutory_rates_<YYYY>.json` to the new year.
2. Update `tax_year`, `year_of_assessment`, `effective_from`, `effective_to`, `source_reference`, keep `is_active: 1`.
3. Update the values that changed; recompute each PAYE bracket's cumulative `base_tax` (= previous bracket's base + previous width × previous rate); `amount_over` equals the bracket's lower bound.

The loader globs `statutory_rates_*.json` and picks the pack whose effective window contains the payroll date — no registration step.

## Step 2 — Add supporting fixtures

In the same folder, add for the new year: `tax_slabs_<YYYY>.json`, `tax_rebates_<YYYY>.json`, `payroll_period_<YYYY>.json`, and `holiday_list_<YYYY>.json` (include any once-off public holidays). ETI slabs and travel rates seed automatically from the rate pack.

## Step 3 — Rehearse, migrate, clear cache, verify

Commit the new files and source references, run static/unit tests, restore representative production data to staging, and back up database/files. On staging:

```bash
bench --site <site> migrate
bench --site <site> clear-cache
```

Then in the console confirm the new year resolves:

```python
from za_local_payroll.utils.statutory_rates import get_rate_pack

get_rate_pack("<a date in the new tax year>")["tax_year"]
```

Add date-parameterised tests asserting headline values, boundaries and every mid-year effective-date change. Then run the documented payroll/VAT/COIDA E2E scenarios and obtain practitioner signoff before the controlled production migration.

## Watch list — confirm each year

- PAYE brackets, rebates, thresholds (SARS Budget Tax Guide).
- Medical scheme tax credits.
- ETI band amounts and thresholds, **and their effective month**.
- UIF monthly remuneration cap.
- Prescribed reimbursive travel rate per km.
- Subsistence daily amounts.
- COIDA annual earnings cap (separate assessment-year cycle).
- Retirement lump-sum / severance tax tables.
- Date-effective official interest rates and housing valuation values.

## After updating

Update each employee's **Salary Structure Assignment** from 1 March to link the new year's **Income Tax Slab**, so PAYE uses the new brackets from the new tax year's first run.

Successful migration and tests prove technical consistency with encoded expectations, not legal correctness. Preserve the official source, review evidence and signoff with the release record.
